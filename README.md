# ðŸ“š About

Group project made in UnB, for the course "OrganizaÃ§Ã£o e Arquitetura de Computadores" (Computer Architecture & Organization), which we learned about machine language assembly RISC-V, types of CPU, datapaths and many hardware in-depth concepts. The project proposal was to recreate the Game Boy Advance game PokemÃ³n FireRed with assembly RISC-V. We used [RARS](https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars) and VSCode to program, and [FPGRARS](https://github.com/LeoRiether/FPGRARS) to execute the game. Also, we adapted the game so it could run in a FPGA DE1-SoC kit, there was many limitations with functions and storage, but we worked around it.
