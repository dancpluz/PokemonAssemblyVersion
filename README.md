Group project made in University of Bras√≠lia, for the course "Organiza√ß√£o e Arquitetura de Computadores" (Computer Architecture & Organization), in which we learned about machine language assembly RISC-V, types of CPU, datapaths and many hardware in-depth concepts. The project proposal was to recreate the Game Boy Advance game Pokem√≥n FireRed with assembly RISC-V. We used [RARS](https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars) and VSCode to program, and [FPGRARS](https://github.com/LeoRiether/FPGRARS) to execute the game. Also, we adapted the game so it could run in an FPGA DE1-SoC kit, there were many limitations with functions and storage, but we worked around it. Making a game with assembly language is not practical at all, but it gave us a good understanding of how the hardware works and many programming concepts, how to handle problem-solving situations and manage teamwork. 

You can find the more descriptive report, in scientific article model, only in Portuguese [here](Grupo7_Trabalho.pdf).
